# Python Basics

* What is __init__?
 
The __init__ method is a special method in Python classes, commonly known as the constructor. It is automatically called when an instance of the class is created. This method is used to initialize the attributes of the class

* What does self mean?
  
self is a reference to the current instance of the class. It is used to access variables that belong to the class. It allows each instance of the class to keep track of its own attributes and methods

* What does an object refer to?
  
An object is an instance of a class. In Python, everything is an object, including numbers, strings, functions, and classes. An object is a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions) that act on the data

* Formatted Strings with print(f"")

 Formatted string literals (also known as f-strings) provide a way to embed expressions inside string literals, using curly braces {}. The expressions are evaluated at runtime and formatted using the str.format() method.

 * Classes and Objects

 A class is a blueprint for creating objects. Classes encapsulate data for the object and methods to manipulate that data. An object is an instance of a class  

* Defining Methods

Methods are functions defined within a class that describe the behaviors of the objects created from the class

* Instantiating Objects

To create an instance of a class (i.e., an object), you call the class using its name and pass any required parameters.
